Experimentation of immutable data structures in scala

Goals:

1. Provide safe and functional data structures
2. Efficient implementations with reliable benchmark against std collection

Inspiration:

*  Purely Functional Data Structures of Chris Okasaki
*  [scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz)
*  haskell base
